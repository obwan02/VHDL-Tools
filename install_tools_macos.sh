	# The best, and most obvious way to extract the version of 
	# llvm required, is to simply run `ghdl -v` and grep the version
	# out.
	#
	# However, because we've potentially just installed GHDL,
	# we might not be able to run it (immediately) due to MacOS security
	# privileges. This means the installation would have to be
	# run twice - with the user allowing ghdl to run inbetween.
	#
	# So instead we can just be a little sneaky and extract the
	# version string from the binary file itself with a little magic

	# Use `strings` to extract readable text from binary, and grab the LLVM
	# version string (which is luckily just sitting in plaintext)
	llvm_version=$(strings /opt/homebrew/bin/ghdl | sed -nE "s/llvm ([0-9]+)\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+.*/\1/p")
